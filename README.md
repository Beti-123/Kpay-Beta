# Kpay-Beta
All car services together in one place - online!

Kpay Master plan:
Introduce the car industry of Kosovo to the internet.

Many services and products take hours, if not days to find in the current state of things. You'll have to go through a hassle, call 7 different repair shops. This could all be online.

One of our branches will offer a card for seamless payments, connected through your phone to display the items you've purchased and their prices. Envision a future where you don't have to wait in line at the grocery store. Specific terminals will be installed at stores to expedite the checkout process for K-pay card users

The business plan is to charge a very small fee to users while enhancing their experience. Once K-pay has demonstrated success in reducing the workload for businesses and improving their user experience, we can charge a small fee to them as well.
